# ERC-8004 and A2A Demonstration

This project demonstrates the core concepts of ERC-8004 (Trustless Agents) and its conceptual integration with the Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol.

## Goal

The primary goal is to illustrate how ERC-8004's on-chain registries (Identity, Reputation, and Validation) can provide a trust layer for autonomous agents, enabling discovery, reputation tracking, and verifiable task execution. We will also conceptually show how an A2A-enabled agent would leverage these registries.

## Technologies Used

*   **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment for compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts.
*   **Solidity**: For writing the ERC-8004 smart contracts.
*   **JavaScript/TypeScript**: For deployment and interaction scripts.

## Demonstration Steps

1.  **Setup Hardhat Project**: Initialize a Hardhat project within this directory.
2.  **Implement ERC-8004 Contracts**: Create Solidity smart contracts for:
    *   `IdentityRegistry`: To register agents and their metadata.
    *   `ReputationRegistry`: To record feedback and reputation signals for agents.
    *   `ValidationRegistry`: To facilitate the validation of agent task execution.
3.  **Deploy Contracts**: Write a script to deploy these contracts to a local Hardhat network.
4.  **Simulate Agent Interactions**: Create a script that simulates the following:
    *   An agent registering itself with the `IdentityRegistry`.
    *   Another agent providing feedback via the `ReputationRegistry`.
    *   An agent requesting validation for a task via the `ValidationRegistry`.
    *   Conceptual integration points with A2A for agent discovery and secure communication.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the demonstration.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  Navigate to the `Erc8004` directory:
    ```bash
    cd c:\Users\Promi\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\ACP\Erc8004
    ```
2.  Initialize a Hardhat project (this will be done in the next step by the assistant).
3.  Install dependencies (this will be done in the next step by the assistant).

## Running the Demonstration

(Instructions will be added here after implementation.)
